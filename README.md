### Real-Time High Scale Financial Fraud Risk Management
This project employs a state-of-the-art fraud risk management approach designed for real-time payments and transaction systems. It consists of processes and technologies to meet increasing consumer and business expectations while managing financial crime risk effectively at scale.

## Challenge
The speed of movement of money domestically as well as internationally has been on an ever-increasing mode with the advent of disruptive payment systems, technologies, and frameworks such as IMPS, UPI, ONDC, and cross-border money transfers and payment linkages among others. Unfortunately, as the speed of payments increases along with real-time settlement, financial crime risks are on the rise at an appalling pace in terms of number and types. The present challenge that large financial companies are facing is to provide real-time payment services securely with continual increase in payment transactions and payment channels while being agile in fraud prevention and responding fast to fraud detection. Financial institutions want a fraud solution to help them make timely decisions that significantly improve fraud detection rates, reduce false positives, optimize operational costs, and drive efficiency and customer satisfaction.

The goal of this challenge is to have in place tools, models, and frameworks that leverage data and analytics and use AI/ML technologies to prevent, detect, learn from, and mitigate financial fraudulent activities and/or attacks at real-time while delivering a seamless and delightful digital banking, digital payments or any other financial activity experience.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Synthetic Financial Datasets For Fraud Detection. It is a synthetic dataset generated by the PaySim mobile money simulator. PaySim simulates mobile money transactions based on a sample of real transactions extracted from one month of financial logs from a mobile money service implemented in an African country. The original logs were provided by a multinational company, who is the provider of the mobile financial service which is currently running in more than 14 countries all around the world.
